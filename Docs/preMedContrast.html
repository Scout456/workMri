			Elective Premedication (12 hours)<br><br>

Oral: 32 mg methylprednisolone orally 12 hours and 2 hours before
contrast medium administration.<br><br>

IV: 40 mg methylprednisolone IV 12 hours and 2 hours before contrast
medium administration.<br><br>

(discordance is because the IV data uses 200 hydrocortisone which is
equivalent to 40 methylprednisolone)<br><br>

Elective premedication maybe considered in the following settings:<br><br>

1. Outpatient with a prior allergic-like or unknown-type contrast reaction
to the same class of contrast medium (e.g., iodinated – iodinated).<br><br>

2. Emergency department patient or inpatient with a prior allergic-like or
unknown-type contrast reaction to the same class of contrast medium
(e.g., iodinated – iodinated) in whom the use of premedication is not
anticipated to adversely delay care decisions or treatment.<br><br>

Accelerated Premedication (4-5 hours)<br><br>

Methylprednisolone 40 mg IV or hydrocortisone 200 mg IV immediately,
and every 4 hours until contrast medium administration, plus<br>

diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 1 hour before contrast medium
administration.<br><br>

Accelerated premedication may be considered in the following settings:<br><br>

1. Outpatient with a prior allergic-like or unknown-type contrast reaction
to the same class of contrast medium (e.g., iodinated – iodinated) who
has arrived for a contrast-enhanced examination but has not been
premedicated and whose examination cannot be easily rescheduled.<br><br>

2. Emergency department patient or inpatient with a prior allergic-like or
unknown-type contrast reaction to the same class of contrast medium
(e.g., iodinated – iodinated) in whom the use of 12-hour premedication
is anticipated to adversely delay care decisions or treatment.<br><br>

Premedication regimens less than 4-5 hours in duration have not been
shown to be effective. No premedication strategy is a substitute for pre-
administration preparedness as reactions occur despite premedication.<br><br>

In a critical patient, a physician may, upon discussing with the patient
and carefully weighing the risks of contrast reaction against the benefit
of obtaining a contrast-enhanced scan sooner, elect to administer
contrast media before the completion of the above regimens.
