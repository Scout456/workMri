Attached is the SBAR regarding EEG Leads 

For MRI BRAINS

Previously, it was communicated that if the EEG leads were still attached we could only scan for a total of 20 minutes.  

Dr Kantartzis has given the ok for the W/WO protocol to be scanned as it is built in the 1.5T scanner at approximately 25 minutes in Normal Mode.
