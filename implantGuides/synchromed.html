			<h1>Medtronic SynchroMed Infusion Systems</h1>
			<h3>Applicable Models</h3>
			<p>SynchroMed 2, Model #8637</p>
			<p>SynchroMed EL, Model #8627</p>
			<p>SynchroMed 3, Model #8667</p>

			<h3>Scanner Parameters</h3>
			<h4>Philips Ingenia 1.5T</h4>
			<p>
				The referring physician or consulting physician must confirm, in
				writing, that the patient may safely be deprived of drug delivery. The
				radiologist must confirm that the pump is not oriented 90° to the
				z-axis. Move the patient into and out of Zone IV slowly to minimize
				Lenz’s forces. Scan only in Normal Operating Mode. Do not exceed 30
				minutes of continuous scan time per 90-minute window. Maintain
				communication with the patient at all times. Assess for heating,
				excessive vibration, or other disturbances. Verify that the patient is
				feeling normal and is responsive between each sequence. After the scan,
				the clinician or Medtronic must interrogate the pump to ensure proper
				function
